Instructions:

The program is ran with the main.py function, which will call the remaining programs as needed. Run in the terminal with python3 main.py. 

The CustomTkinter, Psycopg2, and Pillow libraries are necessary to run the program. They should be installed with:
```
pip install Pillow
pip install customtkinter
pip install psycopg2-binary
```
In the future a separate window will be needed to run the python traffic generator, but that is not necessary at this time.
