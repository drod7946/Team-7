Instructions:

The program is ran with the main.py function, which will call the remaining programs as needed. Run in the terminal with python3 main.py. 

Tkinter needs to be installed. The CustomTkinter, Psycopg2, Pillow, and PyGame libraries are necessary to run the program, and are installed through pip. They should be installed with:
```
sudo apt install python3-venv python3-pip
sudo apt-get install python3-tk
pip install Pillow
pip install customtkinter
pip install psycopg2-binary
pip install pygame
```
In the future a separate window will be needed to run the python traffic generator, but that is not necessary at this time. 

To input the hardware ID's into the database. Enter the equipment ID first then the player ID (name). Then click enter and the data will be added into the database.
